I have several roles at Fermilab, including associate division head for science in the SCD, scientist on the Muon g-2 experiment and researcher in Quantum Computing in the Fermilab Quantum Institute (FQI).\nSome history: I received my Ph.D. in particle physics in 1997 from the University of Maryland under Nick Hadley. For my thesis, I performed a search for hadronic supersymmetry (squarks and gluinos) at the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron particle collider. I did not find any supersymmetry, unfortunately (but neither has anyone else!). After graduating, I became a postdoc for the University of Rochester under Ed Thorndike stationed at Cornell University and worked on the CLEO experiment. There, I studied asymmetry in $b \\rightarrow s\\gamma$ decays (bottom quarks decaying to strange quarks and photons). In 2002, I returned to Fermilab and D0 as a scientist studying diboson events. D0 and the Tevatron ended operations in 2011 and soon thereafter I was one of the founding scientists on the Fermilab Muon g-2 experiment.\nI enjoy presenting science and computing to the public and students, having given several talks at libraries and schools. I also give tours of D0 as well as Muon g-2 when we aren\u0026rsquo;t running. I once unknowingly gave a D0 tour to a New York Times journalist (he did not identify himself as such) that he described in an article (see towards the bottom). The only celebrity I\u0026rsquo;ve given a D0 tour to is Mickey Dolenz from the Monkees. Leading public tours is my favorite thing to do and I\u0026rsquo;m amazed that people from all over the world specifically come to Fermilab as part of their vacation.\nYou may find my short CV that I use for DOE proposals here.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":1565671096,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am a particle physicist and senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in the Scientific Computing Division (SCD).

Both are similar in how they organize the input configurations and output results. And in both cases, the simulation has to be analyzed and consolidated into results that then go into summaries for publications and presentations. Fermilab scientists, in collaboration with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, will explore and provide tools from their experience in high-energy physics to produce and analyze simulations using high-performance computers at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. In particular, they will simulate the operation of a particular kind of qubit device, one that uses structures called acceleration cavities (used in particle accelerators) and can maintain its information over a relatively long time. Their results will determine the device\u0026rsquo;s impact on algorithms relevant to high-energy physics using Argonne-developed parallelized quantum simulators. By better understanding these devices and bringing the tools and expertise from high-energy physics to quantum computing, the team will advance the broader field of quantum computation.\n","date":1565568000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565671096,"objectID":"59b2615ed85b0b272433af58416a8552","permalink":"/project/qc_hep_hpc/","publishdate":"2019-08-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/qc_hep_hpc/","section":"project","summary":"Large Scale Simulations of Quantum Systems with Analytics for HEP Algorithms.","tags":["QC"],"title":"Simulations of Quantum Systems","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Academic is designed to give technical content creators a seamless experience.
