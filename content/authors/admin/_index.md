I am a particle physicist and senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (<a href="http://www.fnal.gov">Fermilab</a>) in the Scientific Computing Division (<a href="http://computing.fnal.gov">SCD</a>). I have several roles at Fermilab, including associate division head for science in the SCD, scientist on the <a href="http://muon-g-2.fnal.gov">Muon g-2 experiment</a> and researcher in Quantum Computing in the Fermilab Quantum Institute (FQI). 

Some <a href="https://academictree.org/physics/tree.php?pid=796328&pnodecount=5&cnodecount=2&fontsize=1">history</a>: I received my Ph.D. in particle physics in 1997 from the University of Maryland under Nick Hadley. For my <a href="https://www.osti.gov/biblio/1421716">thesis</a>, I performed a search for hadronic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersymmetry">supersymmetry</a> (squarks and gluinos) at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DÃ˜_experiment">D0 experiment</a> at the Fermilab <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevatron">Tevatron</a> particle collider. I did not find any supersymmetry, unfortunately (but neither has anyone else!). After graduating, I became a postdoc for the University of Rochester under <a href="http://www.pas.rochester.edu/people/faculty/thorndike_edward/index.html">Ed Thorndike</a> stationed at Cornell University and worked on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLEO_(particle_detector)">CLEO experiment</a>. There, I studied asymmetry in $b \rightarrow s\gamma$ decays (bottom quarks decaying to strange quarks and photons). In 2002, I returned to Fermilab and D0 as a scientist studying diboson events. D0 and the Tevatron ended operations in 2011 and soon thereafter I was one of the founding scientists on the Fermilab Muon g-2 experiment. 

I enjoy presenting science and computing to the public and students, having given several talks at libraries and schools.  I also give <a href="https://ed.fnal.gov/programs/tours/dzero.shtml">tours of the D0 detector</a> as well as the Muon g-2 experiment. I once unknowingly gave a D0 tour to a New York Times journalist (he did not identify himself as such) that he described in an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/28/travel/science-tourism-cern-fermilab.html">article</a> (see towards the bottom). The only celebrity I've given a D0 tour to is <a href="https://news.fnal.gov/2017/02/hey-hey-its-monkey-micky-dolenz/">Mickey Dolenz</a> from the Monkees. Leading public tours is one of my favorite things to do and I'm amazed that people from all over the world specifically come to Fermilab as part of their vacation. 

You may find my short CV that I use for DOE proposals <a href="files/lyon-doe-cv.pdf">here</a>.

I have a list of recent <a href="talks/">Public Talks</a> and <a href="publications/">Publications</a>.
