Adam L. Lyon is a senior scientist at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (<a href="http://www.fnal.gov">Fermilab</a>) in the Scientific Comnputing Division. He is the associate division head for science and works on the Muon g-2 experiment and is also involved in Quantum Computing in the Fermilab Quantum Institute (FQI). 

Adam received a Ph.D. in particle physics in 1997 from the University of Maryland under Nick Hadley. He performed a search for hadronic supersymmetry (squarks and gluinos) at the D0 experiment at the Fermilab Tevatron particle collider. He was then a postdoc for the University of Rochester under Ed Thorndike stationed at Cornell University and worked on the CLEO experiment. There, he studied b quarks decaying to s quarks and photons. In 2002, he returned to Fermilab and D0 as a scientist studying diboson events. 
Adam is currently working on the <a href="bttp://muon-g-2.fnal.gov">Muon g-2 experiment</a>, is a manager in the Fermilab Scientific Computing Division, and is working on Quantum Computing.
