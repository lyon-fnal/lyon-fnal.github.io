I am the lead principal investigator on a project funded by the Department of Energy QuantiSED program. The project's title is "Large Scale Simulations of Quantum Systems with Analytics for HEP Algorithms".

The large scale-simulation of quantum computers has elements in common with simulations in high-energy physics: Both need to sweep over a large number of variables. Both are similar in how they organize the input configurations and output results. And in both cases, the simulation has to be analyzed and consolidated into results that then go into summaries for publications and presentations. Fermilab scientists, in collaboration with scientists at Argonne National Laboratory, will explore and provide tools from their experience in high-energy physics to produce and analyze simulations using high-performance computers at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. In particular, they will simulate the operation of a particular kind of qubit device, one that uses structures called acceleration cavities (used in particle accelerators) and can maintain its information over a relatively long time. Their results will determine the device's impact on algorithms relevant to high-energy physics using Argonne-developed parallelized quantum simulators. By better understanding these devices and bringing the tools and expertise from high-energy physics to quantum computing, the team will advance the broader field of quantum computation.
